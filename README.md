HOW IT WORKS:
1.User Input:The user enters a value in miles into a text input field.
2.Triggering Calculation:The user clicks the "Calculate" button, which calls the calculate() function.
3.Conversion:
-Inside the calculate() function, the value entered by the user (in miles) is retrieved using miles.get().
-The input is converted from miles to kilometers by multiplying the value by 1.609 (since 1 mile = 1.609 km).
4.Displaying Result:The result, rounded to two decimal places, is displayed in a label (the res_label) as kilometers.
5.Input Validation:If the user enters an invalid input (non-numeric or empty), the program catches the error and displays "Invalid input" in the result label.
6.Interface Updates:The Tkinter interface automatically updates with the new result, providing an interactive experience for the user.

FEATURES:
-A form input box where a user will enter the number of miles they want converted to kilometers.
-A Calculate button that triggers the conversion and outputs the kilometers.
